            <p>
                Hey, I’m Alex! I’m a 20-year-old college senior working toward my B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, set to graduate in just three years (Spring 2026). I’m passionate about solving problems with data and always eager to learn new things. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me in gym, playing soccer, exploring new hiking trails, or something car related. I love challenges, whether it’s in academics, sports, or personal growth, and I’m always looking for the next opportunity to push myself further.
