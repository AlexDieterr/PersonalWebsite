        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            TRAFFIC OVERVIEW is a widely debated phenomenon in professional sports, particularly in the NFL. 
            Many believe that playing at home gives teams a significant edge due to factors like travel fatigue, 
            crowd energy, and environmental familiarity. This project examines the impact of home-field advantage 
            using data from 57 NFL seasons (1966-2023), analyzing over 14,000 games. The goal is to quantify the extent 
            of home-field advantage and determine what factors contribute most to its effect on game outcomes.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            • Overall Win Rate: Home teams won 58% of games, while away teams won 42%.<br>
            • Point Margins: Home teams, on average, won by 2+ points more than away teams.<br>
            • Travel Distance Impact: Teams traveling longer distances had lower win rates, 
              with a sharp drop for very long travel (49.2%) compared to moderate travel (57–58%).<br>
            • Playoff vs. Regular Season: Home-field advantage was even stronger in playoff games, 
              with home teams winning 65.9% of the time and winning by an average of 6.15 points.<br>
            • Rivalry Games: Home teams still had an advantage, but rivalry games were closer contests, 
              with a significantly smaller win margin compared to non-rivalry games.<br>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
           The Property Price Predictor is a machine learning project that estimates the median house value of California neighborhoods using census data from 1990. Each data point represents a district rather than a single home, with features describing income levels, population, housing characteristics, and location. 
        </p>     
        
        <br>
        

        <p>

           The goal of this project was to understand what factors influence housing prices and to compare different machine learning models to see which one performs best. I started with basic models and gradually moved to more flexible approaches, focusing on feature engineering and model evaluation. This project also explores how location and income interact with housing density to affect property values.

    <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
       <p>
  • Model Performance: The tuned Random Forest model achieved an R² score of about 0.81 on the test data, outperforming both linear regression and a single decision tree.<br>
  • Error Metrics: The final model produced a mean absolute error of roughly $32,000, which is reasonable given the wide range of housing prices in the dataset.<br>
  • Feature Importance: Median income was the strongest predictor of housing prices, followed by location-based features such as latitude and longitude.<br>
  • Household Ratios: Engineered features like rooms per household and population per household helped capture housing density effects and improved accuracy.<br>
  • Prediction Behavior: When tested on realistic neighborhood scenarios, the model produced sensible predictions, with lower values for inland, lower-income areas and higher values for coastal, higher-income areas.<br>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Pediatric Dashboard is a project I built during my time as a Data Scientist Intern at Kaiser Permanente. It’s an interactive dashboard that tracks key pediatric surgical metrics and helps clinical teams monitor trends in patient outcomes. I organized and cleaned ACS NSQIP data, (American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality  Improvement Program) built the visuals, and structured everything so physicians and analysts can quickly find what they need. The goal was to make the data easier to understand and to support better decision-making in real clinical settings. One of the highlights of this project was the Opioid Reduction Project, which analyzed the frequency and dosage of opioids prescribed post-surgery, helping identify what doctors at what Kaiser Permanente locations were overprescribing and where improvements could be made.
