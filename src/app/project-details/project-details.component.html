        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Home-field advantage is a widely debated phenomenon in professional sports, particularly in the NFL. 
            Many believe that playing at home gives teams a significant edge due to factors like travel fatigue, 
            crowd energy, and environmental familiarity. This project examines the impact of home-field advantage 
            using data from 57 NFL seasons (1966-2023), analyzing over 14,000 games. The goal is to quantify the extent 
            of home-field advantage and determine what factors contribute most to its effect on game outcomes.

    <div class="results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            • Overall Win Rate: Home teams won 58% of games, while away teams won 42%.<br>
            • Point Margins: Home teams, on average, won by 2+ points more than away teams.<br>
            • Travel Distance Impact: Teams traveling longer distances had lower win rates, 
              with a sharp drop for very long travel (49.2%) compared to moderate travel (57–58%).<br>
            • Playoff vs. Regular Season: Home-field advantage was even stronger in playoff games, 
              with home teams winning 65.9% of the time and winning by an average of 6.15 points.<br>
            • Rivalry Games: Home teams still had an advantage, but rivalry games were closer contests, 
              with a significantly smaller win margin compared to non-rivalry games.<br>
