# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site was built from scratch to showcase my data science, machine learning, and software projects in a clear and interactive way. It serves as a central place to present full project workflows, results, and supporting materials beyond just code notebooks.

The website is designed to be simple, responsive, and easy to navigate, with a focus on clearly communicating technical work to both technical and non-technical audiences.
